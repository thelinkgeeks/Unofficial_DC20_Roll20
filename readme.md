Version: 0.1

I have created a functioning character sheet within Roll20 for the DC20 Sample Rules that are on the Kickstarter. It is pretty bare bones, but does have some auto calculations and configured rolls.

If you want to use it, then whoever makes the game will need a Pro subscription with Roll20 to be able to add the custom character sheet.

You can add the custom character sheet by doing the following:

- Go to the home page of your game, then click Settings and Game Settings.
- Change the Character Sheet Template to Custom.
- Click sheet.html, on this page, and then copy all of the code (or you can click the button beside RAW at the top right of the code to copy it all).
- Go back to roll20 and paste it in HTML Layout.
- Click sheet.css, on this page, and then copy all of the code (or you can click the button beside RAW at the top right of the code to copy it all).
- Go back to roll20 and paste it in CSS Styling.
- Then go to the bottom of the page and click Save Changes.

You should have access to this character sheet inside the game now.

I made some updates to the sheet.

1. Added Dark Mode.
2. Fixed Awareness.
3. Added the ability to add custom languages.
4. Added Armor, PDR, and Class specific PD and MD.
